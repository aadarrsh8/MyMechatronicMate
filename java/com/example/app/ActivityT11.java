Three phase rectifiers are used in place of single phase rectifiers to reduce ripple factor. Comparing the two types of rectifiers, three phase is preferred when using large systems. This is because they can deliver large amounts of power and do not require any additional filter to reduce ripple factor.

The half cycle can be either positive or negative. It is the simplest rectifier as only one single diode is used. Due to the pulsating nature of the direct current, ripple factor is high. This means that half wave rectifiers are not considered to be efficient and they often need filters to reduce ripple factor. A high AC voltage is applied to the primary side of the step-down transformer. The obtained secondary low voltage is applied to the diode. The diode is forward biased during the positive half cycle of the AC voltage and reverse biased during the negative half cycle.When a diode is reverse biased, it acts as an open switch. Since no current can flow to the load, the output voltage is equal to zero.";

These types of transformer divides input AC into two parts â€“ positive and negative. Due to this, full wave rectifiers are considered much more effective as the ripple factor is much lower in comparison. Also, as both cycles are allowed at the same time, it means that no signal is wasted. Like the half wave circuit, a full wave rectifier circuit produces an output voltage or current which is purely DC or has some specified DC component. Full wave rectifiers have some fundamental advantages over their half wave rectifier counterparts. The average (DC) output voltage is higher than for half wave, the output of the full wave rectifier has much less ripple than that of the half wave rectifier producing a smoother output waveform. n a Full Wave Rectifier circuit two diodes are now used, one for each half of the cycle. A multiple winding transformer is used whose secondary winding is split equally into two halves with a common centre tapped connection, (C). This configuration results in each diode conducting in turn when its anode terminal is positive with respect to the transformer centre point C producing an output during both half-cycles, twice that for the half wave rectifier so it is 100% efficient.";

The diodes are considered to work in pairs, with one pair allowing electric current through the positive half cycle and the other half allowing current during the negative half cycle. The input alternating current is applied across two terminals and the output direct current is obtained across the resistor inductor which is connected between the other two terminals. Bridge rectifiers allow electric current during both positive and negative half cycles of the input AC signal. These circuit configurations do not require center tapped transformers, which can be very expensive.";
