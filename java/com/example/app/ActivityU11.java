Applications of rectifier products include fixed access network, wireless access network, transmission network and communication network of enterprise.

One very important note when it comes to high output alternators and bridge rectifiers. When we upgrade the output of our alternator, we must also upgrade the diodes in the bridge rectifier to a higher amperage rating. We use Heavy Duty Single, Dual and Triple Internal and External Bridge Rectifiers to increase the durability and prevent High Output Alternator failure.";

With smaller uninterruptible power supply systems (i.e. below 3 kVA) it is not uncommon for the rectifier and battery charger to be separate components.
